# A list of publicly known but unfixed security bugs

Please submit a pull request if you have corrections or know about any other unfixed security bugs.


## tar

* [rmt filename support makes tar vulnerable to "phishing" attacks](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=290435)


## Chrome

* [CSS mix-blend-mode is bad for your browsing history](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2016/08/css-mix-blend-mode-is-bad-for-keeping.html) ([demo](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/whack/))


## Pretty much every terminal emulator

* [Multi-line pastes from an untrusted source (e.g. browser) can automatically execute something you did not intend to copy](https://www.google.com/search?q=terminal+security+paste&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)


## sudo

* sudo TTY tickets (generally enabled by default) allow *any subprocess* to do a passwordless sudo within the timeout period, not just commands you've typed into the shell.


## VirtualBox

* Unlike VMware Workstation, [VirtualBox clipboard sharing gives guests continuous access to the clipboard](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/16508), instead of just when the VM is focused.


## Xorg

* [Any program connected to the server can sniff another program's keystrokes](https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html).  Solved in Wayland.


## Node

* [node climbs up to look for node_modules in directories that can be written to by other users](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/8830)


## Erlang/OTP

* [You can crash a distributed Erlang node by making ~1M connections with an invalid security cookie](https://blog.voltone.net/post/12)

* [Check for null bytes in binaries / strings when opening files](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-370)

* [Stored XSS vulnerability in mod_dir](https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-330)


## Twisted

* [Credentials materials are compared unsafely throughout Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4536), still open due to the difficulty of measuring whether the constant-time compare function actually fixes anything.

* [twisted.web has no protection against HTTP response-splitting attacks](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3770)

* [twisted.web server has no way to limit size of request body](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4898)


## alchemist-server

* [Server executes arbitrary code from remote machines](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server/issues/14)


## alchemist.vim

* [Bundled alchemist-server is vulnerable to remote code execution](https://github.com/slashmili/alchemist.vim/issues/85)


## WeeChat

* [WeeChat relays allows clients to execute code on the relay](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/928)


## phantomjs, libqtwebkit4, libqt5webkit5

* These packages exist in a state of permanent insecurity because they don't keep up with the ~6-week browser update cycle.  (e.g. take any one of the many WebKit security bugs fixed after the last release of these packages, which could be a ~year old.)


## Windows 7 through 10

* [Various methods of automatically bypassing UAC](http://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=3643&start=130#p30022) (see "Unfixed methods in upcoming Windows 10 RS2 release")

## perl

* [Various unicode identifier bugs](http://perl11.org/blog/unicode-identifiers.html)
* [Storable stack overflows](http://perl11.org/cperl/perl5260cdelta.html#Security) and other minor issues
